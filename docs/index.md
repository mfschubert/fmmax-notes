# fmmax-notes

These docs are a reference for the [fmmax](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fmmax) simulator, and aim to provide both a general background of the Fourier Modal Method (FMM) as well as some implementation details and example usage.

The docs are currently highly incomplete, and are being selectively extended based upon need. Please file an issue if you are wanting specific aspects to be documented.
